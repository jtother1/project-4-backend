Ringo and Friends is a app forum style where owners create a profile for their dogs to create an online environment to ask for help in regards to questions. Users can ask questions about health issues, vet recommendations, dog park recommendations, or set up open playdates. Users will interact with each other by creating posts and be able to comment on them.
